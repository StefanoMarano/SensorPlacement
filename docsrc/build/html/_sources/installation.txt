============

This page describes the steps necessary to install WaveDec.

Install Python
##############

* Install Python 3 and the Python package installer by running::

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

* The following Python libraries are needed: ``glob, os, errno, sys, yaml, time, csv, logging, argparse, numpy, scipy, matplotlib``

  On Ubuntu many packages are installed with the default Python 3 installation. You may need to run::

    sudo apt-get install python3-yaml python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib

  Alternatively, you may need to try::

    sudo pip3 install <package_name>


Install Gurobi
##############

The computationally intense job is performed by an external, thirt-party, solver Gurobi. Download, install, and get a licence for `Gurobi <http://www.gurobi.com/>`__.

Configure it for usage with Python as instructed in the manual.

If you are installing Gurobi on a machine where you do not have super user privileges, use the ``--user`` flag::

    python setup.py install --user
